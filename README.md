This is a tutorial for **AGEC-LCI**: AGricultural Emissions Calculator for life cycle inventory.

# Description

🛠️ AGEC-LCI is a VBA tool that generates inventory reports of direct field emissions resulting from the application of soil amendments, fertilizers, and metal-based fungicides in agriculture. This tool aims to facilitate modelling the foreground processes of agricultural systems and avoid the potential inconsistent linking between life cycle inventory (LCI) and life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) phases.
